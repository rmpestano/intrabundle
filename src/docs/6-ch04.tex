\chapter{Bundle Introspection Results}

Intrabundle was used to introspect and apply its metrics to 10 real OSGi projects, the projects are all open sourced and vary and size, teams and domain. 

\section{Analyzed Projects}
In this section is presented an overview of projects that were analyzed during this work. Table \ref{osgi-analyzed-projects} shows projects in terms of \emph{size}:

Below is a brief description of each project:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{BIRT}: is an open source software project that provides the BIRT technology platform to create data visualizations and reports that can be embedded into rich client and web applications, especially those based on Java and Java EE;
\item \textbf{OSEE}: The Open System Engineering Environment is an integrated, extensible tool environment for large engineering projects. It provides a tightly integrated environment supporting lean principles across a product's full life-cycle in the context of an overall systems engineering approach;
\item \textbf{Dali}: The Dali Java Persistence Tools Project provides extensible frameworks and tools for the definition and editing of Object-Relational (O/R) mappings for Java Persistence API (JPA) entities;
\item \textbf{Jitsi}: is an audio/video Internet phone and instant messenger written in Java. It supports some of the most popular instant messaging and telephony protocols such as SIP, Jabber/XMPP (and hence Facebook and Google Talk), AIM, ICQ, MSN, Yahoo! Messenger;
\item \textbf{JOnAS}: is a leading edge open source Java EE 6 Web Profile certified OSGi Enterprise Server;
\item \textbf{Karaf}: Apache Karaf is a small OSGi based runtime which provides a lightweight container onto which various components and applications can be deployed
\item \textbf{Openhab}: a open source home automation software for integrating different home automation systems and technologies into one single solution that allows over-arching automation rules and that offers uniform user interfaces;
\item \textbf{Pax CDI}: brings the power of Context and Dependency Injection(CDI) to the OSGi platform; 
\item \textbf{Tuscany SCA}: is a programming model for abstracting business functions as components and using them as building blocks to assemble business solutions; 
\item \textbf{Virgo}: is a completely module-based Java application server that is designed to run enterprise Java applications and Spring-powered applications with a high degree of flexibility and reliability; 
\end{enumerate}
