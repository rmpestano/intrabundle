 Todays software applications are becoming more complex, bigger, dynamic and harder to maintain. One way to overcome modern systems complexities is to build modular applications so we can divide it into small blocks which collaborate to solve bigger problems, the so called \emph{divide to conquer}. Another important aspect in the software industry that helps building large applications is the concept of software quality because its well known that higher quality softwares are easier to maintain and evolve at long term.

The Open Services Gateway Initiative(OSGi) is the \emph{de facto} standard for building Java modular applications but there is no automated way to measure the quality of OSGi systems. In the context of Java applications there are many well known quality metrics and tools to measure application's quality but when we move to Java modular applications where standard quality metrics does not fit or even exist we run out of options. 

In this work will be presented a tool called \emph{Intrabundle} that analyses OSGi projects and measure their quality. Its also proposed 6 metrics based on good practices inside OSGi world which are applied to 10 real OSGi projects which vary in size, teams and domain.
